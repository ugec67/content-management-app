üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js & npm: Download and install from nodejs.org. npm comes with Node.js.

Git: Download and install from git-scm.com.

Firebase CLI: If you plan to deploy to Firebase, install the CLI globally:

npm install -g firebase-tools


1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/creator-cms-app.git
cd creator-cms-app


(Remember to replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username and creator-cms-app with your repository name if it's different.)

2. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Node.js packages:

npm install


This command will install React, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, and all other dependencies listed in package.json.

3. Firebase Project Setup
To connect your app to Firebase:

Create a Firebase Project: Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

Register a Web App: In your Firebase project, add a new web app and copy its configuration.

Update src/App.js: Replace the firebaseConfig object in src/App.js with your project's configuration.

Enable Services:

Firestore Database: Go to "Build" > "Firestore Database" and create a new database (start in test mode for quick setup, but review security rules for production).

Authentication: Go to "Build" > "Authentication" > "Sign-in method" and enable "Anonymous" sign-in.

Firestore Security Rules: Ensure your Firestore rules allow authenticated users to read and write data. For private user data, the rules should look something like:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{documents=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}


4. Tailwind CSS Configuration
Ensure your Tailwind CSS files are correctly set up:

src/tailwind.css: Make sure this file contains the Tailwind directives:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;


tailwind.config.js: This file should be in your project's root directory and configured for dark mode and content scanning:

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./public/index.html",
  ],
  darkMode: 'class', // Enable dark mode via class
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}


If this file doesn't exist, create it by running npx tailwindcss init in your project root after npm install.

public/index.html: Ensure this file does NOT contain any Tailwind CSS CDN links or manual <script src="../src/index.js"></script> tags. Create React App handles these automatically. Refer to the public/index.html content provided in previous communications.

üèÉ Running the Application Locally
Once all dependencies are installed and configurations are set, you can run the application in development mode:

npm start


This will open your application in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

üì¶ Deployment (Firebase Hosting)
To deploy your application to Firebase Hosting:

Build the project for production:

npm run build


This command creates an optimized build folder.

Deploy to Firebase Hosting:

firebase deploy --only hosting


Make sure you are logged into the Firebase CLI (firebase login) and have initialized Firebase Hosting in your project (firebase init hosting).

üí° Usage
Dashboard: View, edit, and delete your existing posts. Posts are sorted by creation date.

New Post: Create a new content piece, select the target platform, add platform-specific details, and choose whether to save as a draft or schedule for publication.

Edit Post: Modify existing posts.

View Post: See a detailed view of a single post.

Dark/Light Mode: Toggle the theme using the button in the header.
